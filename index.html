      Stories of how the Kipferl ‚Äî and so, ultimately, the croissant ‚Äî was
      created are widespread and persistent culinary legends, going back to the
      19th century. However, there are no contemporary sources for any of these
      stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799, does not mention the
      Kipferl in a long and extensive list of breakfast foods.

      The legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate the
      defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in 732,
      with the shape representing the Islamic crescent; that it was invented in
      Buda; or, according to other sources, in Vienna in 1683 to celebrate the
      defeat of the Ottomans by Christian forces in the siege of the city, as a
      reference to the crescents on the Ottoman flags, when bakers staying up
      all night heard the tunneling operation and gave the alarm.
